!Series_summary	"Variation in individuals' adaptive immune response is believed to influence susceptibility to complex diseases in humans. The genetic basis of such variation is poorly understood."
!Series_summary	"We measured gene expression from resting and activated CD4+ T cells derived from the peripheral blood of 348 healthy individuals. We activated the primary T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads."
!Series_overall_design	"We collected peripheral blood from each human donor. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Ficoll, and negatively selected for CD4+ T cells using RosettaSep. We then either left cells unstimulated or stimulated them with beads conjugated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 either without additional cytokines, or with IFNb, or with Th17 cocktail. Cells were harvested at 0hr, 4hr (anti-CD3/CD28 +/- IFNb) or 48hr (anti-CD3/CD28 +/- Th17) and lysed, and RNA was isolated to be profiled on NanoString."
